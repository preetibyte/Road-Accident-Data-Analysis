# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis

## Project Objective
This project aims to create a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. It providing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to road accidents and valuable insights like factors contributing to accidents, identify patterns, and propose data-driven recommendations for improving road safety. The dashboard analyses a dataset containing information about casualties, vehicle types, road conditions, location, time, weather conditions, severity and other relevant factors.
## Dataset Used
1.	File Name: <a href="https://github.com/preetibyte/Road-Accident-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Data.xlsx">Road Accident Dataset</a>
2.	Rows: 307,974.
3.	Fields/Columns: 21.
## Data Cleaning
The dataset downloaded available in a xlsx file. After downloaded, it needed some cleaning.
- Checked for empty cells and delete it.
- Replaced misspelt words
- Added year and month which was retrieved from date as it would be needed for analysis
## Data Processing
In this do some calculations and add some customized columns. Use Text Function to extract month and year from Date column
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The road accident dashboard provides the following KPIs and insights:
Primary KPIs:
1.	Total Casualties: The total number of casualties that occurred after the accidents.
2.	Casualties by Accident Severity: Total casualties and its percentage with respect to the accident severity level (e.g., fatal, serious, slight).
3.	Maximum Casualties by Vehicle Type: Identification of the vehicle type involved in accidents with the highest number of casualties.
Secondary KPIs:
1.	Casualties by Vehicle Type: Distribution of casualties based on the type of vehicles involved.
2.	Monthly Trend Comparison: Monthly Trend showing Comparison of casualties  between the current year and the previous year.
3.	Maximum Casualties by Road Types: Identification of road types associated with the highest number of casualties.
4.	Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface: Breakdown of casualties based on the road surface conditions.
5.	Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night: Analysis of the relationship between casualties and the time of day in different areas or locations.
